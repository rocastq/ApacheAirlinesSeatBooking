# Seat Booking System

This Python program implements a seat booking system for Apache Airlines' Burak757 passenger jets. The system allows users to check seat availability, book seats, free booked seats, and view the current booking state. The program runs in a loop, presenting a menu of options until the user chooses to exit.

## Features

- **Book a Seat**: Reserve a seat if it is available.
